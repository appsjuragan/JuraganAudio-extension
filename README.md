## 🔥 Why JuraganAudio?

Most browser equalizers are simple filters that can distort or muddy your audio. JuraganAudio is different. It's a full-fledged **Audio Engine** designed for audiophiles and power users who demand the best.

### 🚀 High-Performance DSP
At its core, JuraganAudio runs a custom-built **Rust DSP Engine** compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)**. This means:
- **Zero Latency**: Real-time processing that keeps up with your music, movies, and games.
- **Extreme Precision**: Mathematical accuracy in every frequency adjustment for a professional sound.
- **Ultra Efficiency**: Studio-grade processing that won't slow down your browsing experience.

### 🎨 11-Band Parametric EQ
Take total control of your soundscape. From deep, bone-shaking bass to crystal-clear vocals, our 11-band equalizer uses professional-grade filters (Low-shelf, Peaking, and High-shelf) to shape your audio exactly how you want it.

### ✨ SBR (Spectral Band Replication)
Missing that high-end sparkle? Our SBR technology intelligently reconstructs high frequencies, bringing life back to compressed audio and low-quality streams. It's like "un-clogging" your audio for a crisp, airy finish.
